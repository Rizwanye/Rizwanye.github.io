=======================

This is a one-page mobile-friendly website powered by Jekyll that I use to act as an interactive online CV. It contains my programming skills, education, work experiences and online projects.

The profile was forked via adamouization with my own customisation.
As i most likely wont maintain this repository. I dont recommend forking it, as I plan to do some random coding lingo.
